# Stupax
### "You are not the guy, you are the level!"
*Stupax* is a funny sidescroller (jump and run game) where you do not control the character, but the level. You control a movable platform to help the guy (namely *Stupax*) to get through the levels.

### Features
- Physics engine
- Gamepad controls (using the [Gamepad API](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/gamepad-api-in-web-games/))
- Level editor

It is written purely in JavaScript using [BabylonJS](http://babylonjs.com/).
So it runs in every browsers (Chrome or Chromium recommended due performance reasons).
